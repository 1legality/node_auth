Not really anything but a node js / Express / typeORM app with authentification already settled.

Most of the code comes from

https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/09/09/build-crud-app-node-mysql

and

https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/creating-a-rest-api-with-jwt-authentication-and-role-based-authorization-using-typescript-fbfa3cab22a4

Then I just added passport for Google and Facebook authentification.

Might be a good foundation for future projects / hackaton.

The mysql database needs Docker to run.
